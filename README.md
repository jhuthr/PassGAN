 PassGAN

This repository contains code for the [_PassGAN: A Deep Learning Approach for Password Guessing_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00440) paper. 

The majority of the credit for the code in this repository goes to @beta6 for his work on the [Generative Adversarial Network Password Generator](https://github.com/beta6/PassGAN). I have updated the python code to allow compatibility with the most recent versions of Tensorflow and other required libraries.
